Hint: 
Let denote Black Cap as 0 and White cap as 1

1. Nth person will EXCLUSIVE OR all the 0's and 1's
2. If the result is 0, he will say Black, otherwise White
3. N-1 th person knows that, the EXCLUSIVE OR of his cap and the caps in front of him is what is said by Nth people.

Thus 1 to N-1 th person can know what is their own cap color.




Note:
EXCLUSIVE OR outputs 0 for the similar input and outputs 1 for different input
e.g.
1 XOR 1 = 0
1 XOR 0 = 1
0 XOR 1 = 1
0 XOR 0 = 0
